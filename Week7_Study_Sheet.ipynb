    "Objectives:        \n",
    "1. Understand how images are represented in computers       \n",
    "          \n",
    "images are stored as a matrix of numbers that represent pixel intensity the larger the number the more saturated the pixel is. Color images are typically set up as three matrices setting the colors red, green, and blue and of three dimensions (height, width, and color). (all same size) Some may have a fourth, alpha channel, for transparency or store the colors in a different order thn the standard RGB.\n",
    "              \n",
    "            \n",
    "The first dimension is usually the height dimension starting from the top of the image.\n",
    "The second dimension is usually the width, starting from the left.\n",
    "The third dimension is usually the color. This is the \"channel\" dimension.\n",
    "For example, the 0th row (the top), the 0th column (the left), and the 0th color (usually red).\n",
    "      \n",
    "Attention:\n",
    "In numpy, and other libraries that rely on numpy, the order of axes is rows, columns, pages, this is different from what you might expect, if you are thinking in terms of x-position, y-position, z-position, because rows is the vertical or y-position and columns is the horizontal or x-position.\n",
    "      \n",
    "2. Issues of applying models to images             A) we have to unravel the image to make it flat losing the relationship of surrounding pixels.    \n",
    "    B) Lighting will affect the pixel values (a car will have a very different set of pixel values if it is cloudy vs sunny)\n",
    "    C)Humans are very good at  finding shapes and using those to classify an image. \n",
    "    D) you can think of shaoes/edges as the difference in adjoining pixels\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. Understand basic feature extraction      \n",
    "it may be useful to give the image edges, instead of pixel intensities, to train and predict on. there are multiple ways to do this: \n",
    "   \n",
    "use the gradient(rate of change) of the pixel intensities. look for the direction of 'color' change.(using grayscale from here on out)\n",
    "\n",
    "Sobel Operator - used to gain information about the pixels surrounding the single pixel. The convolution can be slid over the image to end up with a new image where evey pixel now represents numerically the surrounding pixels.   \n",
    "     \n",
    "The magnitude is calculated between these two edge detectors to get the final result.  \n",

    "normalization of images first is usually recommended.  \n",
